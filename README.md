# Bearcave

Bearcave is a honeypot written in python that's meant to emulate an SSH server to fool incoming attacks. Bearcave is currently limited in scope and the commands that work, but the plan is to emulate a fully functioning linux terminal that is indistinguishable from the real thing to a limited extent. Other future plans include logging commands executed, and files that are attempted to be downloaded.
